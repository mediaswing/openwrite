//! The language-file format, and everything that can be done with one file.
//!
//! The format is deliberately small enough to explain in a paragraph, because
//! the person writing one is a translator rather than a programmer and the
//! whole point of this system is that they never have to open Rust:
//!
//! ```text
//! # A comment. Every entry here carries its English source in one of these.
//! code   = "fr"
//! name   = "Français"
//! plural = "french"
//!
//! # Scenes
//! outline.heading = "Scènes"
//!
//! # A long one, continued by putting another quoted string underneath.
//! outline.empty.hint = "Une intitulé de scène commence par INT. "
//!                      "ou EXT."
//! ```
//!
//! Two decisions are worth the words:
//!
//! **Nothing here fails as a unit.** A line the parser cannot make sense of
//! becomes a [`Problem`] and the rest of the file is still read. A translator
//! mid-file should not be shown an editor stripped of its text because of one
//! stray quote, and a writer who was sent a well-meant but slightly broken file
//! should still get the ninety percent of it that parses.
//!
//! **Placeholders are named, never positional.** `{name}` rather than `{}`,
//! because word order is the first thing a translation changes and a format
//! that fixes the order of the inserted values is a format that mistranslates
//! by design.
